Association rules: or Market basket analysis or Relationship mining or Affinity analysis
Intuation:
What goes with what?
Are certain group of items are frequently brought together?
What business strategies will you device with this knowledge?

There should be some kind of metrics to say our association is succesful: Support, confidence and lift

If part called Antecedent
then part Consequent

Support: Measure of frequency; n(A&C)/Total transactions; order doesn't matter
Confidence: Uniqueness of combination; n(A&C)/n(A); Order maters; Confidence is biased because High support implies high confidence.
Lift ratio: Consequent might be generic. hence we need one more statastical measure; confidence/Benchmark confidence; Benchmark confidence = n(c)/Total transactions
If lift ratio >1 then it's likely to be considered as likely combinations.
